This is a simple clone of the Google homepage for The Odin Project.
http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css?ref=lnav

The goal is to recreate the Google homepage:
https://www.google.com/

I'm happy with the version of the homepage I have created up to this
point. Effort went into aligning the divs into columns for the menu
in the upper right corner. Additionally, I had some difficulty
creating the blue border that is shown when the input field is
selected. This required an additional CSS class and some JQuery.
Using JQuery, the box arround the input field is toggled based on
the focus on the input field.

Elements of this project which are still incomplete:
- Footer menu
- Change "I'm Feeling Lucky" text on hover
- Adjust spacing in upper right menu
- Adjust postion of all element on the page to exactly match Google
- Connect all the elements to submit search queries

At this point, I am abandoning this project and moving forward with
The Odin Project. I have learned a few new things about HTML, CSS,
and JQuery. However, I may return to this and integrate some portion
of this code into future projects in my studies.
